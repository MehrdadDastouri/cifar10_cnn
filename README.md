# CNN for CIFAR-10 Classification

"This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained on the dataset and evaluated for accuracy on a test set."

Features:
  - Implements a simple CNN with:
      - Two convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling.
      - Fully connected layers for classification.
  - Trains and evaluates the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  - Visualizes:
      - Training loss over epochs.

Dataset:
  - CIFAR-10:
      - Training samples: 50,000
      - Test samples: 10,000
      - Classes: 10
